## Objectives

Your project accounts for 70% of your final grade.

Here, you need to first reproduce one of the following  papers in the list using a framework of your choice.

Secondly, you need to come up with solutions to further improve the performance metrics of your choice. Your final grade depends on (i) the rigorousness and correctness of your reproduction experiments, (ii) the percentage of performance improvement of your solution compared to the original paper, (iii) the readability of your report.

We provide you Pytorch-based of distributed/decentralized framework: You can find the implementation and user manual below. We also provide you the google cloud coupon so that you can reproduce the results on the Google cloud.

## Key milestones

Milestones:

1. **Project proposal** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 5
2. **Intermediate project meeting** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 9
3. **Final project report** (mandatory, graded): due on week 14
4. **20 min project presentation** (mandatory, graded): due on week 14

All the documents need to be submitted via the ILISAS. Exact due dates are on the ILIAS.

## Grading breakdown of the project

- Final report: 65%
- 20 min project presentation: 15 %
- Individual contribution: 20%



## Final project report

The **final** group project report should be ** 7-8 pages**.
Here is the report template. https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml2025-template/dhxrkcgkvnkt
 <!---The **intermediate** project report is likely to be shorter (it is due a week before the final deadline), that is fine, submit whatever you have by then.)
 -->

We suggest the following final report structure:

- Motivation
- Background of the paper
- Method proposed by the paper
- Reproducing results (with a lot of figures and tables)
- Your proposed improvement, describing the weakness of current paper and  your optimization algorithms
- Conclusions: what can be the future direction
- References

The final report should also contain a link to a repository (or several) that contain the software you created, the scripts you used to analyze your data, etc.

Submission: every group uploads their intermediate presentation and final group project reports on ILIAS. The reports should be in PDF format.

In addition, your report must also include a figure that graphically depicts a major component of your project (e.g., your approach and how it relates to the application, etc.). Such a summary figure makes your paper much more accessible by providing a visual counterpart to the text. Developing such a concise and clear figure can actually be quite time-consuming; I often go through around ten versions before I end up with a good final version.

The final project report is graded in combination with the project interview. The interview will be an academic discussion about the executed project.

### Interviews

The 20 minute interviews per group will be scheduled on the last lecture.
